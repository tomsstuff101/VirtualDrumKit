Brief
Assign different keys to the different drum sounds.

The sounds have been provided for you to use. You have also been given a background image to use, however if you are feeling up to the challenge you can make your own drum kit using HTML and CSS.


End Goal
A user should be able to use your program to play the different drum sounds by pressing different keys on the keyboard. You will need to display to the user which keys to use.
